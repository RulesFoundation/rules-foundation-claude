# Policy Encoding Skill

This skill provides patterns and guidance for encoding tax and benefit law into executable DSL code.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Where Encodings Go

**ALL statute encodings MUST go in `rac-us`:**

```
~/RulesFoundation/rac-us/statute/
├── 26/           # Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code
│   ├── 1/        # § 1 - Tax rates
│   ├── 24/       # § 24 - Child Tax Credit
│   ├── 32/       # § 32 - EITC
│   ├── 36B/      # § 36B - Premium Tax Credit
│   ├── 62/       # § 62 - AGI
│   ├── 63/       # § 63 - Standard Deduction
│   ├── 199A/     # § 199A - QBI Deduction
│   ├── 1401/     # § 1401 - SE Tax
│   ├── 1411/     # § 1411 - NIIT
│   └── 3101/     # § 3101 - Medicare Tax
└── 7/            # Title 7 - Agriculture (SNAP)
    └── 2017/     # SNAP allotment
```

**NEVER put encodings in:**
- ❌ `rac` - Only DSL parser/executor
- ❌ `rac-validators` - Only validation infrastructure
- ❌ `atlas` - Only raw source documents

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Validation Requirement

**ALL encodings MUST be validated on full CPS microdata:**

```python
# In rac-validators
from rac_validators.cps.runner import CPSValidationRunner

runner = CPSValidationRunner(year=2024)
results = runner.run()  # Runs on ~100k+ households
```

**NEVER validate with just hand-crafted test cases.** The CPS validation:
- Tests on real income distributions
- Catches edge cases you'd never think of
- Compares against PolicyEngine AND TAXSIM
- Reports match rates with statistical significance

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Filepath = Citation

**The filepath IS the legal citation.** This is the most important encoding rule.

```
statute/26/32/c/3/D/i.rac  →  26 USC § 32(c)(3)(D)(i)
statute/26/121/a.rac      →  26 USC § 121(a)
statute/26/1411/a.rac     →  26 USC § 1411(a)
```

### Pre-Encoding Workflow (MANDATORY)

1. **Parse the target filepath** to understand which subsection you're encoding
2. **FETCH THE ACTUAL STATUTE TEXT** from Supabase (`arch sb usc/{title}/{section}`) or Cornell LII BEFORE writing anything
3. **Verify the text matches** the subsection you're claiming to encode
4. **Only encode what that subsection says** - nothing more, nothing less

### Common Errors That Cause Misalignment

❌ **Content from wrong subsection** - If encoding (c)(3)(D)(i), don't include rules from (ii) or (iii)
❌ **Formula oversimplification** - Implement exactly what the statute says, no shortcuts
❌ **Wrong paragraph numbering** - Verify (d)(5) is actually (d)(5), not (d)(9) mislabeled

### One Subsection Per File

Each file encodes EXACTLY one statutory subsection:
- ✅ Create `D/i.rac`, `D/ii.rac`, `D/iii.rac` for three subparagraphs
- ❌ NOT one `D.rac` file with all three mixed together

## Encoding Workflow

### Step 1: Create .rac File in rac-us

```yaml
# statute/26/1411/a.rac
# 26 USC § 1411(a) - General Rule

"""
(a) General rule.— Except as provided in this section, there is hereby imposed...
a tax equal to 3.8 percent of the lesser of—
(1) net investment income, or
(2) modified adjusted gross income in excess of the threshold amount.
"""

niit_rate:
    description: "Tax rate on net investment income"
    unit: rate
    from 2013-01-01: 0.038

net_investment_income_tax:
    imports:
        - 26/1411/c#net_investment_income
        - 26/1411/b#threshold_amount
    entity: TaxUnit
    period: Year
    dtype: Money
    unit: "USD"
    label: "Net Investment Income Tax"
    description: "3.8% tax on lesser of NII or excess MAGI per 26 USC 1411(a)"
    from 2013-01-01:
        excess_magi = max(0, modified_adjusted_gross_income - threshold_amount)
        return niit_rate * min(net_investment_income, excess_magi)
```

Tests go in a separate `.rac.test` file:

```yaml
# statute/26/1411/a.rac.test

net_investment_income_tax:
    - name: "MAGI below threshold"
      period: 2024-01
      inputs:
        net_investment_income: 50_000
        modified_adjusted_gross_income: 180_000
        threshold_amount: 200_000
      expect: 0
```

### Step 2: Add to CPSValidationRunner

Edit `rac-validators/src/rac_validators/cps/runner.py`:

```python
VARIABLES = [
    # ... existing variables ...
    VariableConfig(
        name="niit",
        section="26/1411",
        title="Net Investment Income Tax",
        rac_file="statute/26/1411/net_investment_income_tax.rac",
        rac_variable="net_investment_income_tax",
        pe_variable="net_investment_income_tax",
        taxsim_variable=None,  # TAXSIM doesn't have NIIT
    ),
]
```

### Step 3: Run Full CPS Validation

```bash
cd ~/RulesFoundation/rac-validators
source .venv/bin/activate

python -c "
from rac_validators.cps.runner import CPSValidationRunner

runner = CPSValidationRunner(year=2024)
results = runner.run()

# Check results
for name, result in results.items():
    if result.pe_comparison:
        print(f'{name}: {result.pe_comparison.match_rate:.1%} match')
"
```

### Step 4: Iterate Until >99% Match

If match rate is low:
1. Check mismatch examples in `result.pe_comparison.mismatches`
2. Fix formula logic
3. Re-run CPS validation
4. Repeat until >99% match rate

| `rac-us` | **US federal statutes** | ✅ YES |
| `rac-validators` | Validation infrastructure | ❌ NO |
| `rac` | DSL parser/executor | ❌ NO |
| `atlas` | Raw source documents | ❌ NO |

## Common Tax Variables

| Variable | Statute | File Path |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| EITC | 26 USC § 32 | `statute/26/32/a/1/earned_income_credit.rac` |
| CTC | 26 USC § 24 | `statute/26/24/child_tax_credit.rac` |

| Premium Tax Credit | 26 USC § 36B | `statute/26/36B/premium_tax_credit.rac` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Encoding is in `rac-us/statute/` (NOT rac, validators, or atlas)
- [ ] CPS validation run on full microdata (NOT just hand-crafted test cases)
- [ ] Match rate >99% against PolicyEngine
- [ ] Every formula cites statute subsection
- [ ] No hardcoded dollar amounts (use parameters)
- [ ] Variable added to CPSValidationRunner.VARIABLES
- [ ] Inflation indexing encoded as rule, not value
- [ ] Test cases cover phase-in, plateau, phase-out
- [ ] Test cases cover all filing statuses
- [ ] Validation achieves FULL_AGREEMENT
- [ ] Edge cases tested (exact thresholds, zero values)

## Phase-In/Phase-Out Validation (CRITICAL)

For credits with phase-in and phase-out regions, **verify these are DIFFERENT rates**:

| Credit | Phase-In Rate | Phaseout Rate | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| EITC (1 child) | 34% | 15.98% | Different! |
| EITC (2 children) | 40% | 21.06% | Different! |
| EITC (3+ children) | 45% | 21.06% | Different! |
| EITC (0 children) | 7.65% | 7.65% | Same (special case) |

### Reference Point Validation

**ALWAYS verify these reference points before completing encoding:**

1. **At phase-in threshold**: Credit should equal max_credit
   ```
   earned = earned_income_threshold
   → credit = min(max_credit, earned × phase_in_rate) = max_credit
   ```

2. **At phase-out end**: Credit should equal zero
   ```
   earned = phase_out_end
   → credit = max(0, max_credit - (earned - phase_out_start) × phaseout_rate) = 0
   ```

### Rate Derivation Check

**Phase-in rate = max_credit / earned_income_threshold**

Example (EITC 1 child, 2024):
- max_credit = $4,213
- earned_income_threshold = $12,391
- phase_in_rate = 4213/12391 = 0.34 (34%)

If your formula uses a DIFFERENT rate for phase-in than this derivation, you have a bug.

### Bug Prevention: Experiment 2025-12-27T1530

This validation section was added after discovering a bug where `phaseout_rate` was
incorrectly used for phase-in calculations. This caused a -$9.2B gap vs PolicyEngine.
See `autorac/optimization/runs/2025-12-27T1530.yaml`.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLETION CHECKS

Before marking any encoding complete, you MUST verify ALL of the following:

### 1. Subsection Number Verification
**After writing each file**, re-read the statute and verify the subsection number matches:

```
❌ WRONG: h/5.rac contains collectibles (that's h/4)
✓ RIGHT: h/5.rac contains unrecaptured section 1250 gain
```

- [ ] File path number matches statute paragraph number
- [ ] `"""..."""` docstring quotes the EXACT subsection indicated by filepath
- [ ] No content from adjacent subsections leaked in

### 2. Parent File Integration
When creating subdirectory files (e.g., `h/1.rac`), you MUST update the parent file:

```yaml
# In statute/26/1.rac - MUST add import:
income_tax_before_credits:
    imports:
        - 26/1/h/1#capital_gains_tax_under_1h1  # ADD THIS
    entity: TaxUnit
    period: Year
    dtype: Money
    from 2024-01-01:
        ...
```

- [ ] Parent .rac file imports key variables from new subdirectory
- [ ] Parent file's formula uses the imported variables

### 3. Import Resolution
Every import MUST resolve to an existing definition:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - net_capital_gain not defined anywhere
imports:
  - 26/1222#net_capital_gain

# ✓ RIGHT - either create the definition OR use an input
input net_capital_gain:
  entity: TaxUnit
  period: Year
  dtype: Money
  description: "Net capital gain per § 1222(11)"
```

- [ ] Every `path#variable` import has a corresponding definition
- [ ] If definition doesn't exist, create stub file OR use input declaration

### 4. Circular Reference Check
Variables cannot reference themselves or create cycles:

```yaml
# WRONG - circular reference
tax:
    entity: TaxUnit
    period: Year
    dtype: Money
    from 2024-01-01:
        return tax * rate  # References itself!

# RIGHT - separate variables
base_amount:
    entity: TaxUnit
    period: Year
    dtype: Money
    from 2024-01-01:
        return income - deductions

tax:
    entity: TaxUnit
    period: Year
    dtype: Money
    from 2024-01-01:
        return base_amount * rate
```

- [ ] No variable references itself in its formula
- [ ] No A→B→A dependency cycles

### 5. Tests Required
Every variable MUST have at least one test:

- [ ] Every variable has tests in a companion `.rac.test` file
- [ ] Tests cover basic case, edge cases, zero case

## Troubleshooting

**Validation fails with DISAGREEMENT:**
1. Check formula logic against statute text
2. Verify parameter values for the test year
3. Check if PolicyEngine has known issues for this variable
4. Try different test inputs to isolate the discrepancy

**POTENTIAL_UPSTREAM_BUG detected:**
1. Document the discrepancy
2. Check PolicyEngine GitHub issues
3. If new, file issue with test case details
4. Use `rac-validators file-issues` command

**Inflation indexing mismatch:**
1. Verify base year and CPI values
2. Check rounding rules (nearest $10, $50, etc.)
3. Confirm which CPI measure is used (CPI-U vs C-CPI-U)
